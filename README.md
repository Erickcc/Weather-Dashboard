# Weather-Dashboard

The purpose of this activity was to implement different frameworks along with third party and server side APIs in order to develop a simple webpage that displays weather information regarding the inquired city.

The task consisted in building a webpage from zero, we had to retrieve information from a server side API and stored previously browsed cities in local storage. This task was completed designing a basic HTML file to later manipulate the DOM with javascript in order to build a webpage that displayed information regarding an specific city when demanded.

## When the webpage is displayed, then:
* The user can see the previously browsed elements on the left side of the screen
* When the user clicks on these elements, they can see the weather, humidity, wind speed and UV Index or that specific city
* When the user inputs or clicks a city, today's weather as well as the next 5 days information is displayed
* The UV Index for today's weather section change of color depending on how high its value is

After implementing all of the previous requirements, we were supposed to have a webpage that works as a fully functional weather dashboard

## Development process

This activity consisted in implementing server side APIs in order to build a wether dashboard. This task was achieved by doing the following 

* Splitting the webpage into two columns, the left and mid-right side of the screen
* The left side of the screen takes around 20% of the screen
* It has the form that retrieves the city name that the user wants to search
* It also holds the previous browsed cities, these cities are locally stored
* The right side of the screen takes around 78% of the screen
* It displays today's weather information on the top side of the screen
* It also displays the weather information of the next 5 days in small cards, this section is played right under today's weather information
